Welcome to Cryptuon, where we're pioneering the next generation of blockchain technologies and services. Founded by the visionary minds behind the innovative multi-chain API platform, Boom Labs, Cryptuon has taken a bold step into the future by integrating groundbreaking technologies in our projects.

Our journey began in 2021 when our founder worked on Boom Labs in London, UK. Despite its eventual shutdown, the work done at Boom Labs was not in vain. We developed a multi-chain API to bring Web2 and mobile applications on-chain, an MPC wallet, and a high-scale cloud infrastructure. We gained confidence and significant support from investors and received Letters of Intent from publicly listed companies and large startups.

Now, our work at Cryptuon follows the same passion for innovation, technical excellence, and a firm belief in the potential of blockchain technology.
